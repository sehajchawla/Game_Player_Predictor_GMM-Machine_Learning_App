# Game Player Predictor GMM Machine Learning App
This repository uses Gaussian mixture models to classify users of my game- TapCars (on the App Store) as users that will continue to be spending in the next calendar month or not.

The output of this project can be seen in the PNG image, and the output clearly shows that the gaussian mixture model has, indeed, been optimised to fit the two-peak case.
